Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

In this project, I design a static webpage comprising 4 pages for a none profit school for refugee , which I formerly taught at. The Home page will convey the school programs , links to classes, schedules and contact informations. The home page also provide an email subscribtion function link. The Contact page will provide an email form in which anyone interested in school may write to CTC. 

Menu section provide classes and schedule of the schoool. In about session , the admins can add their compelling story about the works that have been done.
